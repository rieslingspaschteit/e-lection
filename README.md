# PSE Project: Secure end-to-end verifiable e-voting system with ElectionGuard

Previously, this was a university project at Karlsruher Institut of Technology (KIT) over a six month period. Worked with the waterfall model, so each phase was greatly sophisticated. The project was graded with 1.0 which is the highest possible grade.

As of now, we will resolve some bugs and issues as well as implement a modern user interface. Further planned, will be the domain use cases, as previously e-lection was not intended for voting on a political scale as there were still some security fixes needing to be done. So in the future, we will further expand the domain use cases of e-lection.
